Run-time history of your own researches is in the app (**History** tab) and in `data/logs/`.

## 2026-10-19 · session 8 — free-key loop review, C1, free-model coder

- **Asked:** run the loop on free keys and review it; store the report; make app changes run on the internal free models instead of Claude Code, autonomously.
- **Loop (free keys only, 2 h):** score 0.789 → 0.878, 44 trials (9 kept). Report: [Improvement_loop_report.md](Improvement_loop_report.md).
- **C1 (coverage-aware score):** started in the Terminal with Claude Code, stopped on the user's request. Its edits (`src/research/score.mjs`, `src/research/improve.mjs`, `tests/research/improve/*.test.ts`) were kept and pass the gate.
- **Free-model coder (`src/coder/`):** App chat tickets are now implemented by free deep models in a sandbox copy. Code applies the edits there, runs `npm run quality`, retries up to 4 times with the failure, and copies the files into the app only on PASS, with a backup and an Undo button. The coder cannot edit the gate, itself, auth, secrets, the terminal or `package.json`, and a change that removes tests fails. `node src/frl.mjs change C<n> --claude` keeps the Claude Code path.
- **Live test of the free coder (C2, "Loop trials (N · K kept)" heading):** 3 runs, all on free keys and none passed the gate, so the app was left unchanged and the sandbox was removed. The fixes it led to: code-side file search (the model first edited the wrong files), excerpts of large files, a whole-file rewrite refused on large files, failing-test detail fed back, a per-attempt log, and a clear message when quotas are spent. In the last run the right file (`public/index.html`) was edited twice with 10/12 e2e passing; then OpenRouter timed out, Pollinations hit its token limit, and Cerebras and Gemini were out of daily quota.
- **Researches list:** one row per main research (the newest run of each question): name, start time, active dot, node count. Nothing else.
- **Selected-pieces loop:** **Select pieces** on the map, with the focus path highlighted and exclusions (dashed red). **Improve loop ▾** is a dropdown: Entire research / Selected pieces. Focus = Q, the primary level, the siblings along the path, and the selected piece's sub-pieces, minus exclusions (`inScope` in `src/research/improve.mjs`). The loop reloads its targets after every trial, so removed pieces no longer crash it.
- **Free routing:** [FREE-ROUTING.md](FREE-ROUTING.md) puts FreeLLMAPI (MIT, 34 providers, per-key daily counters) in front of the app as the `custom` provider. New `node src/frl.mjs keys set NAME`; the key store also holds `CUSTOM_LLM_BASE_URL`, `CUSTOM_LLM_MODEL` and `FRL_PROVIDER_ORDER`.
- **Models & router menu:** a **+** next to the models indicator (and on Setup) opens a modal listing every free model provider and search engine. Each row shows its free tier (checked 2026-10-18), a source link the app checks live, a key input, Save & test (the key is tested with the provider before it goes into the key store), Test, Remove, live state (works / cooling / not working / no key) and this session's calls. It also sets the router order: tick and reorder providers, then save (`FRL_PROVIDER_ORDER`). `src/llm/admin.mjs`, `/api/router*`. Signup links fixed: Pollinations → enter.pollinations.ai, Serper → serper.dev/api-keys. The phone drawer now scrolls.
- **Always-computed result:** the memo prompt no longer allows a bare "INSUFFICIENT DATA"; it must give a verdict and a best estimate with a range. `src/research/gaps.mjs` marks the result provisional, sets a confidence from the checks, and lists every unsettled piece as Fix / Research further / Clarify, with why, the next step and a priority (impact × uncertainty × grade gap; pieces the memo cites first). A provisional memo earns half the loop's decisive bonus.
- **Export:** the Results tab exports the report (.md), pieces & actions (.csv, spreadsheet-safe), delivered items (.csv), everything (.json), and print/PDF.
- **Open:** C2 is ready for Try again after the quotas reset; stale loop targets after a removal; the expand phase bug; 429 benching; critique cost (see the report). Stray "compile .exe" researches still need deleting by the user.

## 2026-10-19 · session 7 — tree & pieces layout, request + desired output, regression checks, scoped loop, app changes from the App chat

**Asked:** left researches; middle tabs: decomposition/dependency map, tree (left) + pieces table and per-role reports (right), sources per piece, gates & logs; all threads and interactions on the right; checkboxes in the tree to run the loop on the whole research or selected pieces; Node and Research chats always with request + desired output for reverse engineering and regression tests. Mid-task: the App chat is responsible for all app changes (features, tests, checks), the main terminal for the app. User decisions: table + selected report; desired output → stored checks; per-research Gates & logs tab.

**Built:**
- Middle tabs: Decomposition map · Tree & pieces · Sources · Results · Report · Gates & logs. Pieces named as in the first version (Q, D1 drivers, D1.1 sub-questions) with role. Per-role reports (research process for sub-questions, roll-up for drivers, decision for Q). Right panel: piece actions, files, instructions, chats.
- `src/research/specs.mjs`: desired output → regression checks (grade, number, range, items, words), evaluated after every run, "regressed" when a passing check fails.
- Loop: scope = whole research or ticked pieces (+ sub-pieces), scope score, regression revert in piece and whole tests; scope survives chat pauses and restarts.
- Node/Research chats require request + desired output; the loop prompt sees the desired outputs.
- App change tickets: App chat proposes `change`; on the button `data/changes/C<n>.md` + `node src/frl.mjs change C<n>` (Claude Code, then the quality gate, result posted to the App chat). `src/changes.mjs`.

**Verified:** `npm run quality` PASSED (185 unit tests, 12 e2e). Live: the App chat turned "add a CSV download to Results, with a test" into a change-ticket proposal (no ticket before the button); new layout screenshotted on the running app.

**Open:** the two stray "compile .exe" researches still need deleting by hand; ticket runs need Claude Code installed on the computer that runs the app; Windows/cloud not run on real machines.

## 2026-10-19 · session 6 — separate chats, reply audit, Results tab, files in chats, terminal, Windows and cloud

**Asked:** (1) remove the research the App chat created by mistake and make that impossible; app conversations only in the App chat, never mixed with research, piece or results chats; go through the flows and cut bad behaviour. (2) A Results tab with its own chat; upload and recognition of files and photos in chats. (3) An exact document for Windows. (4) How to run it always on in a free cloud. (5) A mandatory audit protocol, run at the start of every task and before every result. Mid-task: (6) a master terminal behind a button that replaces `start.command`/`keys.command`, usable from macOS and Windows at the same time. Decision by the user: a real shell from any device, protected by the access token; chats may only propose commands.

**What was wrong (from the App chat thread):** invented links (`app.example.com`), invented keys (`API_KEY=abcd1234`), "I'm opening…" with nothing opened, two "compile an .exe" researches created from requests that were not research, "removed" claimed while nothing was removed, a `git commit -m "Your commit message"` instruction that was followed. Cause: the App chat had no facts or documents, could create researches by itself, and nothing checked its replies.

**Built:**
- Four chats with separate threads: piece, research, **results** (new), **app**. App questions sent to a research chat are answered in the App chat (`scope: "app"`). App reports (started, keys reloaded, research created / finished / deleted, loops, resumes) go to the App chat. [CONCEPT.md](CONCEPT.md).
- App chat grounded in code-checked facts, a search over the app's own guides, and the terminal command list. It runs only open / stop / links; a new research, a deletion, a loop or a command is a **proposal** with Confirm / Run in Terminal. Results-chat actions are proposals too. Replies written before the audit are never used as context and show "not audited".
- **Reply audit** on every chat reply (`src/chat/reply-audit.mjs`): unknown links and key values removed; unknown commands, placeholders and claimed-but-not-run actions flagged; one revision, then a visible ⚠ mark.
- **Results tab**: expected-result checks next to the memo verdict, a notice when the checks pass but the memo does not settle the question, delivered items, passing findings, still-weak pieces.
- **Files in every chat** (📎, drag and drop, paste; up to 4): photos, screenshots, PDFs and MP3/WAV read by a free vision model (Gemini via `image_url`/`input_audio`, verified live; OpenRouter `gemma-4` as fallback), text files by code. In a piece chat they become sources of that piece. Piece uploads take the same types.
- **Terminal** (`src/terminal/`): shared node-pty sessions (zsh / PowerShell / bash; piped fallback), scrollback for late joiners, WebSocket with Origin check, command buttons. `node src/frl.mjs` now does everything on macOS, Windows and Linux: start, install always-on (launchd / Windows logon task / systemd), status, url, restart, update, token, keys setup / check / list / export / import, logs. `keys.command` and `start.command` call it; `start.cmd` and `keys.cmd` added for Windows.
- Security: requests forwarded by a local proxy (Tailscale Funnel, tunnels) are no longer treated as "this computer"; `FRL_BEHIND_PROXY=1` for servers. Linux servers keep keys in systemd encrypted credentials.
- Flow fixes: researches stuck in "researching" after a crash are marked cancelled on start (4 found); restart goes through the graceful shutdown on every OS; `install` waits for launchd to unload (it failed with "Bootstrap failed: 5").
- Docs: [WINDOWS.md](WINDOWS.md), [CLOUD.md](CLOUD.md) (Oracle Always Free + Tailscale Funnel; Google e2-micro is not fully free because of the external IPv4 charge), [AUDIT-PROTOCOL.md](AUDIT-PROTOCOL.md), repo `CLAUDE.md`.

**Verified:** `npm run quality` PASSED (177 unit tests, 10 e2e on iPhone 14 and Pixel 7). Live on the running app with free models: Windows, links, ".exe + git" and cloud questions answered from the guides with the audit passed and no research created; a cloud question asked in a research chat moved to the App chat; a screenshot read by Gemini; Results chat answered from the research; terminal WebSocket refused a cross-site origin (403) and ran commands.

**Open:**
1. The two "Create a research task to compile the application…" researches are still listed: deleting them was refused by the session's permission check. Delete them in the app (open each → More → Delete this research), or ask the App chat, which now proposes a deletion you confirm.
2. The old App chat thread (with the invented links and keys) is still on disk; those replies are marked "not audited" and are never used as context.
3. A Results-chat test re-researched D2 on the cars research before results actions became proposals; it ran on free quotas.
4. Windows and the cloud steps were checked against official docs and unit tests, not on a real Windows PC or VM.

## 2026-10-18 · session 5 — redesigned UI, remote access, uploads, chat tabs

- UI rebuilt on common patterns: sidebar of researches (repeat runs grouped), centered composer, project header (status, Run, Stop, Improve, More), Outline/Map/Findings/Report/Sources tabs, inspector with docked chat; phones get a slide-in menu and a full-screen Details/Chat sheet. Playwright tests on iPhone 14 (WebKit) and Pixel 7 (Chromium) run in the quality gate.
- Remote access: `frl install` runs the app as a macOS login service; other devices need the access token (Keychain) from `frl url`; Tailscale for anywhere access. Keys move between computers as an encrypted bundle (`frl keys export` / `import`).
- Files attach to one piece as cited sources (U1, U2…); chat tabs for this piece, the whole research and the whole app (the app assistant can start researches and loops).
- First result on the cars research with the marketplace scan: 3 live, in-range kleinanzeigen listings; expected result 60% met before the loop.

## 2026-10-18 · session 4 — why there were no results, and the fix

**Diagnosis (cars DE→CZ research):** 6/21 nodes passed, 0 listing links. Causes, in order:
1. The data was unreachable: web search (LangSearch) returns reviews and catalogues, not live listings; the model's direct pages were bare homepages (mobile.de blocks readers).
2. Stop was ignored: the research run cleared the stop flag when it started.
3. Chat changes failed while the loop ran (edits refused) and the loop's revert then overwrote the chat thread.
4. The LangSearch key had been saved without its first character (fixed earlier the same day).

**Fixes:** marketplace connectors with robots.txt enforcement, schema.org extraction, ECB conversion, code-computed stats and trend snapshots; Stop checked between every step; user chat has priority (pause → apply → resume) and survives reverts; classic chat dock (messages scroll, separate input that live updates never clear); app reports posted into the chat.

## 2026-10-18 · session 3 — chat, suggestions, history, gates

**Asked:** save sessions and logs; an AI chat per node that can change the tree; researched sub-issue suggestions; re-research any piece; keep the mechanical gates; apply the newest mikoshi-construct mechanics; ship through the gates; report productivity vs paid models.

**Built:**
- Node chat (`src/research/chat.mjs`): one thread per node and one for the whole project; it can edit, add, remove, expand, suggest and re-research; it cannot write answers or grades.
- Researched suggestions (`src/research/suggest.mjs`): search first, then propose; each suggestion is graded quoted / cited / not grounded by code.
- History tab, `data/logs/*.jsonl` event, model-call and history logs, knowledge record per project (`src/logs.mjs`, `src/research/knowledge.mjs`).
- Gates: item links must appear on a fetched page; wider non-answer check; prices converted at ECB daily rates (`src/research/rates.mjs`); listing-like links ranked first; off-topic Wikipedia hits dropped.
- Self-improving loop UI (hours, start/stop, trials), expected-result field, "Build the tree first" button, deliverables table in Report.
- Ship gate: `npm run quality` (syntax, secrets, no comments, tests present, tests) and a pre-commit hook. See [PROTOCOLS.md](PROTOCOLS.md).

**mikoshi-construct 0.43.0 (latest on npm, 2026-10-09), what was taken:** a pass is reported by the gate, never by the author; secret scanning; commit guard; run ledger; the facts/claims/hypotheses knowledge record; escalate effort only when verification fails. Not taken: the full `construct init` (pnpm + TypeScript + ESLint + OpenAPI scaffolding), which does not fit a zero-dependency Node app.

## 2026-10-18 · session 2 — search, expected result, self-improving loop

- Live capability test: 7/7 marketplace pages readable (mobile.de and olx.pl only through the Jina reader); Groq, Cerebras, Pollinations answer; OpenRouter hit its 50/day cap; the saved Gemini key is invalid; no search key saved, so search was Wikipedia only.
- Added search backends LangSearch, Linkup, Jina, Firecrawl and local SearXNG (`searxng.command`), per-query rotation with 1 h benching, gap-driven re-search.
- Found: page reading dropped every link. Fixed: links kept per page; nodes can list pages to read directly.
- Added the expected-result checks and the per-project self-improving loop.
- First live loop (used cars €2,000–4,000, 10 links): score 0.144 → 0.302 in 25 min, 5 changes kept, but 0 working links, because search was Wikipedia only and guessed marketplace URLs were blocked or filtered by currency. The fixes are in session 3.

## 2026-10-17 · session 1 — the app

- Audited FREECC (tour-business calibration) → `AUDIT.md`; rebuilt as a generic research app: issue tree, free-model router with failover and cooldowns, mechanical verification, decision memo, SSE UI, CLI, templates (generic, car arbitrage, glamping, taxes, market sizing).
- Verified free providers and limits → `KEYS.md`; keys in macOS Keychain via `keys.command`.
- First live research on Groq finished; the git-level prompt self-improvement loop (`npm run autoloop`) ran until the disk filled; 2 prompt changes kept.

## Open items

1. Add Tavily as a second search key (LangSearch and Gemini work as of 2026-10-19).
2. SearXNG needs Docker Desktop restarted (it hung on 2026-10-18).
3. Many marketplaces block readers; CSV upload is the reliable path for listing data.
