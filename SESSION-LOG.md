# Session log

How this app was built, what each session decided, and what is still open. Newest first.
Run-time history of your own researches is in the app (**History** tab) and in `data/logs/`.

## 2026-10-18 · session 3 — chat, suggestions, history, gates

**Asked:** save sessions and logs; an AI chat per node that can change the tree; researched sub-issue suggestions; re-research any piece; keep the mechanical gates; apply the newest mikoshi-construct mechanics; ship through the gates; report productivity vs paid models.

**Built:**
- Node chat (`src/research/chat.mjs`): one thread per node and one for the whole project; it can edit, add, remove, expand, suggest and re-research; it cannot write answers or grades.
- Researched suggestions (`src/research/suggest.mjs`): search first, then propose; each suggestion is graded quoted / cited / not grounded by code.
- History tab, `data/logs/*.jsonl` event, model-call and history logs, knowledge record per project (`src/logs.mjs`, `src/research/knowledge.mjs`).
- Gates: item links must appear on a fetched page; wider non-answer check; prices converted at ECB daily rates (`src/research/rates.mjs`); listing-like links ranked first; off-topic Wikipedia hits dropped.
- Self-improving loop UI (hours, start/stop, trials), expected-result field, "Build the tree first" button, deliverables table in Report.
- Ship gate: `npm run quality` (syntax, secrets, no comments, tests present, tests) and a pre-commit hook. See [PROTOCOLS.md](PROTOCOLS.md).

**mikoshi-construct 0.43.0 (latest on npm, 2026-10-09), what was taken:** a pass is reported by the gate, never by the author; secret scanning; commit guard; run ledger; the facts/claims/hypotheses knowledge record; escalate effort only when verification fails. Not taken: the full `construct init` (pnpm + TypeScript + ESLint + OpenAPI scaffolding), which does not fit a zero-dependency Node app.

## 2026-10-18 · session 2 — search, expected result, self-improving loop

- Live capability test: 7/7 marketplace pages readable (mobile.de and olx.pl only through the Jina reader); Groq, Cerebras, Pollinations answer; OpenRouter hit its 50/day cap; the saved Gemini key is invalid; no search key saved, so search was Wikipedia only.
- Added search backends LangSearch, Linkup, Jina, Firecrawl and local SearXNG (`searxng.command`), per-query rotation with 1 h benching, gap-driven re-search.
- Found: page reading dropped every link. Fixed: links kept per page; nodes can list pages to read directly.
- Added the expected-result checks and the per-project self-improving loop.
- First live loop (used cars €2,000–4,000, 10 links): score 0.144 → 0.302 in 25 min, 5 changes kept, but 0 working links, because search was Wikipedia only and guessed marketplace URLs were blocked or filtered by currency. The fixes are in session 3.

## 2026-10-17 · session 1 — the app

- Audited FREECC (tour-business calibration) → `AUDIT.md`; rebuilt as a generic research app: issue tree, free-model router with failover and cooldowns, mechanical verification, decision memo, SSE UI, CLI, templates (generic, car arbitrage, glamping, taxes, market sizing).
- Verified free providers and limits → `KEYS.md`; keys in macOS Keychain via `keys.command`.
- First live research on Groq finished; the git-level prompt self-improvement loop (`npm run autoloop`) ran until the disk filled; 2 prompt changes kept.

## Open items

1. Save a search key (LangSearch or Tavily) and a new Gemini key: the biggest quality gain left.
2. SearXNG needs Docker Desktop restarted (it hung on 2026-10-18).
3. Many marketplaces block readers; CSV upload is the reliable path for listing data.
